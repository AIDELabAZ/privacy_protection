	* reads in Niger, WAVE 1 (2011), POST HARVEST (second passage), ecvmaas1_p2_en
	* cleans labor post planting - planting labor 
	* cleans labor post harvest - harvesting labor 
	* outputs clean data file ready for combination with wave 1 plot data

* import the first relevant data file

* drop households that did not use field during the rainy season
	drop 	if 	as02aq04 == 2
	*** 460 observations dropped
	*** This variable most closely resembles the variable that asks if fields were cultivated
	*** In wave 2 we dropped observations if fields were not cultivated

* drop the households missing field, parcel, ord to create the id variable
	mdesc clusterid hh_num ord field parcel
	drop	if field==.
	drop    if ord == .
	drop 	if parcel == .
	*** dropped 1630 observations

* per Palacios-Lopez et al. (2017) in Food Policy, we cap labor per activity
* 7 days * 13 weeks = 91 days for land prep and planting
* 7 days * 26 weeks = 182 days for weeding and other non-harvest activities
* 7 days * 13 weeks = 91 days for harvesting
* we will also exclude child labor_days
* will not disaggregate gender / age - pool together, as with other rounds 
* in line with others, will deal with each activity seperately

* create household member labor
