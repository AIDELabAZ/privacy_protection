	* reads in Nigeria, WAVE 2 (2012-2013), POST PLANTING,AG SECT11F
	* determines planting month and year
	* planting dates look ok, so we don't need anything from this file

* assumes

	* mdesc.ado
	
* TO DO:

* check that month and year make sense
	tab				month
	*** monthly planting pattern makes sense
	*** vast majority are in March-June
	*** this aligns with FAO planting season

	tab				year
	*** most report 2012 but some strange results
	*** clearly 1994 is an error, but check 2011 and 2013
	
* month of 2011 and 2013 planting
	tab				month if year == 2011
	tab				month if year == 2013
	*** some of the months are not feasible given the survey timing but some are
	*** since we are dealing with only 67 (0.6%) of all obs, we will assume all are from 2012

* close the log
	log	close
