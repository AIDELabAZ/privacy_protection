* Stata v.16

* does
	* reads in Niger, WAVE 2 (2014), POST HARVEST, ECVMA2 AS2E1P2
	* file will broadly follow ag_i from Malawi "kitchen sink"
	* cleans harvest sold (quantity in kg)
	* determines prices for merge (five files) into 2014_ase1p2

* assumes
	* cleaned version of 2014_ms00p1

* TO DO:

* if directly following malawi, would be able to proceed with different process
* however, did not work in niger
* mismatched when attemping to match it into harvest file 
* look at malawi code for reference, as needed 
* but see 2014_ase1p2 for next steps

	clear 

* close the log
